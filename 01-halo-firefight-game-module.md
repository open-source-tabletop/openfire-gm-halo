## Introduction

# Module Rules

The following special rules are used in Halo Firefight.

## Shields

Some model are equipped with powerful energy shields which absorb incoming damage. These shields are depleted with each additional hit until they fail and the model becomes vulnerable to taking damage. After a short time shields will regenerate allowing the model to repeatedly take hits without being killed. Models with energy shields will have the following special rule:

**Shield (X)**  
When this model is hit by a weapon, before rolling a defence test, it makes a **Shield Test**. For each hit, one at a time, roll a dice. If it is equal to or higher than X then the hit is ignored. If the roll is lower than X then the hit is ignored and this model may not make any more shield tests until the next round.
