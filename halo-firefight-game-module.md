# Halo Firefight

Halo Firefight is a fan made Game Module set in the Halo universe that allows you to enact battles from any era in the Halo timeline. You will need [the core rules for Open Fire](https://github.com/open-source-tabletop/openfire/) to play this game.

## Introduction

> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."

# Module Rules

## Game Modes

Halo Firefight can be played in one of 2 ways, as a normal **battle**, or using the optional **arena** rules. The normal battle mode sees both players bring a small force to the table where they fight to achieve a number of battles while trying to destroy their opponent. The **arena** mode is built around a small number of models which are able to **respawn**, be brought back into the battle after being destroyed, to continue the fight. Players score points for either killing enemy models or for achieving repeatable goals: such as capturing an enemy flag. All the rules for this module apply to both battle and arena modes, while there are a small set of additional rules for the arena mode.

## Special Rules

The following additional special rules are used in Halo Firefight.

#### Shield (X)

This model can ignore the first X points of damage they take during each round.

## Arena Rules

### Stress

Arena games do not use the rules for stress.

### Choosing Armies

Players decide what size of game they wish to play, typically between 2-6 models each, and choose either **Spartans** or **Elites** to represent their team. For arena games these models all use the same profile as shown below, but begin the game with different weapons:

| Model             | MOV | SKL | DEF | CMD | HP  | Special                 |
