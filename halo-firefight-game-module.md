# Halo Firefight

Halo Firefight is a fan made skirmish battle Game Module set in the Halo universe that allows you to enact battles from any era in the Halo timeline.

You will need [the core rules for Open Fire](https://github.com/open-source-tabletop/openfire/) to play this game.

## Introduction

> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."
