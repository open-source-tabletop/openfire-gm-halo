## Introduction

> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."

# Module Rules

## Skirmish Games

You can optionally include the skirmish rules in games of Halo Firefight, this works best when playing smaller scale games or in arena games.

## Game Modes

Halo Firefight can be played in one of 2 ways, as a normal battle, or using the arena rules.

The normal battle mode sees both players bring a small force to the table where they fight to achieve a number of objectives while trying to destroy their opponent. This mode is best for larger games and is better suited to narrative battles.

The arena mode is built around a small number of models which are able to respawn throughout the game, coming back into the battle after being destroyed, to continue the fight. This keeps the game continuosly balanced with a focus on achieving repeatable goals: such as capturing an enemy flag, controlling zones, or simply gaining the most kills.

All the rules for this module apply to both battle and arena modes, while there are a small set of additional rules for the arena mode.

# Additional Rules

## Weapon Swapping

Models that have the Adaptable special rule are able to pickup weapons from the battlefield to use instead of their starting weapons. They may only swap weapons with the swappable special rule.

Any time a model equipped with a swappable weapon is killed within 6 inches of a model with the adaptable special rule they may declare that they are going to swap their weapon. Roll a D12 and on a roll of 7 or more, once the model has been removed, place a marker where the model was last positioned and take note of which weapon was dropped (using tokens you can write on is the best way to do this). If a model has more than 1 weapon the closest player with the adaptable special rule decides which weapon has been dropped.

When a model with the adaptable special rules moves, if at any time during its movement its base comes into contact with this marker, they may choose to replace any of their weapons with the swappable rule, with the weapon that has been dropped. If they do so the weapon they were carrying is removed from their profile and is lost, add the new weapon to their profile. A model may only do this once per activation.

# Halo Firefight Special Rules

The following additional special rules are used in Halo Firefight.

### Adaptable

This model may swap it's weapons during a game following the rules for weapon swapping.

### Dual Wielding

When making an attack with a weapon with this rule you may choose to make another attack, against the same target, with another weapon with the Dual Wielding special rule. If you do so you suffer a -2 modifier to your skill rolls for both attacks.

### Shield (X)

This model may ignore the first X points of damage it receives each round.

### Swappable

This weapon may be swapped by models using the rules for weapon swapping.

### Weak Point

This model has a -2 modifier to its defence rolls against attacks which originate in it's rear arc. In addition, the model does not gain the benefit of the Heavy Armour (X) rule if it has it.

# Arena Rules

Arena mode lets players play small games with a different focus than the normal battles. Both players start with the same number of Spartans, usually between 2 and 8, and compete in either a Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, or King of the Hill mission.

## Spartans

Arena games only feature Spartans from the UNSC army list, however each Spartan starts the game with their default equipment: an MA5 Assault Rifle, M6 Pistol, and M9 Grenade. In addition, Spartans do not choose any of the armor abilities.

If players wish to use Elites in games of Arena they should use the same profile as Spartans for balance, but change their starting equipment to a Plasma Rifle, Plasma Pistol and Plasma Grenade.

## Respawn

## Grenades

All Grenade weapons in Arena games also have the One Use rule.

## Stress

Arena games do not use the rules for stress.

## Weapon Drops

In addition to being able to pick up weapons that other models drop, arena includes weapon drop points. These are markers permanently placed around you battlefield which will randomly drop a weapon each round. At the end of each round, if the marker does not have a weapon on it, and does not have any models within 6 inches, you roll on the weapon table and place the rolled weapon at that location.

| D12 Result | Weapon              |
| :--------: | :------------------ |
| 1-3        | No Weapon Dropped   |
| 4          | M90 Shotgun         |
| 5          | BR55 Service Rifle  |
| 6          | Plasma Rifle        |
| 7          | Needler             |
| 8          | SRS99 Sniper Rifle  |
| 9          | M41 Rocket Launcher |
| 10         | Beam Rifle          |
| 11         | Fuel Rod Gun        |
| 12         | Energy Sword        |

## Arena Objectives

### Team Flags and Team Bases

Team Flags are a new kind of objective used in Capture the Flag style missions. Each player will have one or more Team Base Objectives which have a flag belonging to that player. Any enemy model, simply by moving within 1 inch of an enemy Team Base may pick up the enemy flag. A model may only pick up one flag at a time and may only pick up an enemy flag.

While that model is carrying the enemy flag they may only make attacks using the Spartan Melee Attack weapon as listed in the Spartan Unit Profile. If the model carrying an enemy flag moves within 1 inch of their own team base they score 3 victory points and the flag is returned to the enemy team base.

If the model carrying the enemy flag is destroyed, place a marker where the model was destroyed indicating the position of the flag. If another model from an opposing team moves within 1 inch of the flag they pick up the flag as though they had picked it up from the enemy team base. If a model from the team that owns the flag moves within 1 inch of the marker it is immediately returned to their team base.

If you are using more than one team flag per player you will need to mark each team flag and base with a number to ensure they return to the correct position.
