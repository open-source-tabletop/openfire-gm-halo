## Introduction

> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."

# Module Rules

## Skirmish Games

You can optionally include the skirmish rules in games of Halo Firefight, this works best when playing smaller scale games or in arena games.

## Game Modes

Halo Firefight can be played in one of 2 ways, as a normal battle, or using the arena rules.

The normal battle mode sees both players bring a small force to the table where they fight to achieve a number of objectives while trying to destroy their opponent. This mode is best for larger games and is better suited to narrative battles.

The arena mode is built around a small number of models which are able to respawn throughout the game, coming back into the battle after being destroyed, to continue the fight. This keeps the game continuosly balanced with a focus on achieving repeatable goals: such as capturing an enemy flag, controlling zones, or simply gaining the most kills.

All the rules for this module apply to both battle and arena modes, while there are a small set of additional rules for the arena mode.

# Additional Rules

## Weapon Swapping

Models that have the Adaptable special rule are able to pickup weapons from the battlefield to use instead of their starting weapons. They may only swap weapons with the swappable special rule.

Any time a model equipped with a swappable weapon is killed within 6 inches of a model with the adaptable special rule they may declare that they are going to swap their weapon. Roll a D12 and on a roll of 7 or more, once the model has been removed, place a marker where the model was last positioned and take note of which weapon was dropped (using tokens you can write on is the best way to do this). If a model has more than 1 weapon the closest player with the adaptable special rule decides which weapon has been dropped.

When a model with the adaptable special rules moves, if at any time during its movement its base comes into contact with this marker, they may choose to replace any of their weapons with the swappable rule, with the weapon that has been dropped. If they do so the weapon they were carrying is removed from their profile and is lost, add the new weapon to their profile. A model may only do this once per activation.
